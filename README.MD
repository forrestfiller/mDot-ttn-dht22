# In Progress

### Currently I have this project on my mbed IDE privately, however, once I am able to get gcc-arm to play ball, I will bring my code over here to share with you.

Known issues:
1. DHT11 vs. DHT22 libs:
  - my node is not happy when I use dht11 libs with a dht22 sensor and give me back dissapointing data like: Temp is 503 degrees C, maybe...**don't do this**.
